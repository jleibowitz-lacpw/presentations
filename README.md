Technical deep-dives and concept explorations covering DevOps, SRE, cybersecurity, and modern infrastructure practices. Generally meant to be rendered with a markdown presentation tool like Marp or Slidev. I'll note one versus the other or even expore the text presentation ecosystem.

## What's This?
Presentation materials designed for "Office Hours" discussions—structured, shareable formats that make complex topics accessible. Built with [Marp](https://marp.app/) because Markdown beats PowerPoint every time.

## Why This Matters
- **Bridge the gap** between traditional IT and modern practices
- **Start conversations** about automation, security, and efficiency
- **Document ideas** in a format that's version-controlled and collaborative
- **Make technical concepts** digestible for mixed audiences

## Structure
- **[Potential Topics](./potential-topics)** - Pipeline of exploration areas
- Individual presentations focus on one concept, keep it practical
- Emphasis on real-world application over academic theory

## Topics Cover
- Infrastructure as Code and automation workflows
- Security practices that actually work in bureaucratic environments
- Modern collaboration tools and documentation strategies
- Bridging Windows-first orgs with Linux/open-source best practices

Built for fast iteration, easy sharing, and gradual culture change—because good ideas need the right packaging.
