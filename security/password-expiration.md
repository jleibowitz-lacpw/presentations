# 🔥 The Case Against Forced Password Expiration  
**“Security theater is not security.”**

---

## 🧠 What the Experts Say

### 📜 **NIST (SP 800-63B)**
> “Verifiers **SHOULD NOT** require memorized secrets to be changed arbitrarily (e.g., periodically).”  
— [NIST SP 800-63B, Section 5.1.1.2](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)

NIST’s guidance is clear: **only change passwords when there’s evidence of compromise**. Arbitrary expiration policies reduce security by encouraging predictable patterns and password reuse.

### 🧰 **Microsoft**
> “Password expiration requirements do more harm than good.”  
— [Microsoft Security Baseline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/misc/password-policy-recommendations?view=o365-worldwide)

Microsoft removed password expiration from its baseline in 2019, citing **no measurable security benefit** and **increased user frustration**.

### 🏛️ **FTC**
> “Users who are required to change their passwords frequently select weaker passwords... and change them in predictable ways.”  
— [FTC Tech@FTC Blog](https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2016/03/time-rethink-mandatory-password-changes)

### 🇬🇧 **UK NCSC (GCHQ)**
> “Only ask users to change their password if you suspect it has been compromised.”  
— [NCSC Password Guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/passwords/updating-your-approach)

## 📉 What the Research Shows

### 🧪 **Carleton University Study**
> “The optimal benefit [of password expiration] is relatively minor at best, and questionable in light of overall costs.”  
— [Chiasson & van Oorschot, 2015](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/papers/expiration-authorcopy.pdf)[1](https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2016/03/time-rethink-mandatory-password-changes)

### 🧠 **UNC Chapel Hill**
- 17% of new passwords were cracked in **fewer than 5 guesses**.
- 41% were cracked in **under 3 seconds** using transformations like `Password1` → `Password2`[1](https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2016/03/time-rethink-mandatory-password-changes).

### 📊 **DAAAM Symposium (2023)**
> “Mandatory password changes often conflict with real-world security goals and degrade usability.”  
— [Redzepagic et al., 2023](https://www.daaam.info/Downloads/Pdfs/proceedings/proceedings_2023/working_papers/dpn34029_a_1_Dakic.pdf)[1](https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2016/03/time-rethink-mandatory-password-changes)

## 🧠 Human Behavior: The Weakest Link

### 😩 **Password Fatigue Study (Beyond Identity, 2022)**
- 87% of users report **moderate to high password fatigue**.
- 82% of high-fatigue users **reuse passwords** across accounts.
- High-fatigue users are **twice as likely to be hacked**[1](https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2016/03/time-rethink-mandatory-password-changes).

### 🔁 **Password Change Patterns**
> “Users often make minor, predictable changes to old passwords, undermining the purpose of expiration.”  
— [IACIS Study, 2022](https://iacis.org/iis/2022/2_iis_2022_29-41.pdf)[1](https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2016/03/time-rethink-mandatory-password-changes)

## 💸 The Real Cost of Expiration

### 💰 **Forrester Research**
- Each password reset costs **~$70**.
- 40% of help desk calls are password-related[1](https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2016/03/time-rethink-mandatory-password-changes).
- One org saved **$65,000/year** by eliminating forced resets[1](https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2016/03/time-rethink-mandatory-password-changes).

---

## 🧱 Case Studies: Organizations That Ditched Expiration

- **Microsoft** removed expiration from its baseline in 2019[1](https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2016/03/time-rethink-mandatory-password-changes).
- **Cisco** and others now require changes **only after compromise**[1](https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2016/03/time-rethink-mandatory-password-changes).
- **Tabush Group** reports improved security and user satisfaction after dropping expiration[1](https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2016/03/time-rethink-mandatory-password-changes).

## ✅ What Actually Works

- **Long, memorable passphrases** (e.g., `correct-horse-battery-staple`)
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- **Breach detection** and **password blocklists**
- **User education**, not user punishment

## 🧻 Tape This to the Stall Door

> “Forcing password changes every 90 days is like changing your locks every 90 days — even if no one tried to break in. It’s expensive, annoying, and doesn’t stop burglars.”
